            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I created a schematic, circuit, and code that uses an LED and a variable resistor.
            the code contains for-loops, condition statements, map functions, analogRead(), and analogWrite().</p>
            
            <h2>Schematic and Circuit</h2>

            <p>
                For my circuit, I used a green LED and a photoresistor. 
                The calculations and schematic are shown below:
            </p>

                <img src = "assignment3Asset/a3Schematic.jpg" width = 500px height = 300px> 
            </div>

            <p>
                The actual circuit is shown below. As explained in my calculations above,
                Since the resistance I found is 160Ω for the green LED, any resistor larger than 160Ω  can be used. 
                Thus, I used a 1000Ω resistor across the LED. In addition, since I found the resistance across the 
                photoresistor is 250Ω, I used a 10,000Ω resistor. Pin 11 is connected to the green LED while
                Analog 0 is connected to the photoresistor.

                <p>
                    I mapped the values between 0 and 500 because during testing. When the 
                    circuit was exposed to a bright condition, the detected values ranged between 200 and 500.
                    In contrast, when the lights removed from the setting, the range fell below 100.
