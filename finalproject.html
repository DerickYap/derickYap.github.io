            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project, I decided to build a sound detecting light source! It takes in sound as an input and produces light from the LEDs as an output! This project requires the following components:
            </p>

            <li>
                Arduino  x1 
            </li>

            <li>
                220Ω resistor (anything above 160Ω can be used) x3 
            </li>

            <li>
                Green/Red/Yellow LED x3
            </li>

            <li>
                Sound Sensor (Sound Detection Module LM393) x1
            </li>

            <li>
                Jumper wires
            </li>

            <li>
                9V Battery with DC x1
            </li>

            <h2>Problem</h2>

            <p>
                I wanted to build a sound detecting light source because my apartment gets really dark at night. Looking for the light switch on the wall
                can be troublesome at times. Thus, I wanted to be able to switch the lights on without having to physically look for the switch!
            </p>

            <h2>Schematic and Circuit</h2>

            <p>
                The three green LEDs are connected to Pins 13,12 and 11. Since the voltage drop for a green LED is about 1.8V, using Ohms Law, the resistance calculated will come up to 160Ω. So, any resistor that’s above 160Ω can be used. In this case, I used the 220Ω resistor across each of the LEDs. The sound sensor has 3 channels, VCC, ground and the output. So, I connected it to the 5v pin, ground and Pin 7 on the arduino.

            <p>
                The actual circuit is shown below.

            <h2>Ardunio Code Snippet</h2>
                <img src = "finalProjectAsset/FP_CodeBlock.png" width = 60%>
                <p>
                    I used boolean logics to allow the LED to toggle between the different states. Implementing a simple if, else statement was sufficient to switch the LEDs on and off. So, the first time the device hears a sound, the status becomes true and the LED switches on. The second time it captures sound, the status goes back to false and switches the LED off. I used digitalWrite instead of analogWrite because I am not adjusting the brightness of the LEDs. I only need the two states (HIGH/LOW) for this project.

            <h2>Final Prototype</h2>

            <p>
                My final prototype looks like this where it is enclosed in a box and mounted on the wall in my apartment

            <p>
                I decided to have the power supply outside of the encasing because I thought that it would be much more convenient to change the battery when the source eventually runs out.
