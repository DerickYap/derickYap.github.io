            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I created a webpage with p5.js that interacts with data thatâ€™s coming from the arduino over serial and also
                by interacting with the keyboard, changes the output on the arduino.</p>
            
            <h2>Schematic and Circuit</h2>

            <p>
                For my circuit, I connected an analog with 2 axis thumb joystick. The ground on the analog is connected to the corresponding ground on the board.
                The 5v channel on the analog is connected to the 5v pin on the board, the X and Y channels are connected to A0 and A1 respectively.
                Additionally, I used a green LED which is connected to Pin 13. Since the resistance I found is 160 ohm, 
                any resistor larger than 160 ohm can be used. Thus, I used a 220 ohm resistor across the LED

                The actual circuit is shown below.

                    Code that makes the analog joystick functional and reads if the keyboard is pressed.
                    If the lowercase o is pressed, the LED lights up. If the lowercase f is pressed, the LED
                    is switched off.
