            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>I created a webpage with p5.js that interacts with data thatâ€™s coming from the arduino over serial.</p>
            
            <h2>Schematic and Circuit</h2>

            <p>
                For my circuit, I connected an analog with 2 axis thumb joystick . 
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                The actual circuit is shown below. The ground on the analog is connected to the corresponding ground on the board.
                The 5v channel on the analog is connected to the 5v pin on the board, the X and Y channels are connected to A0 and A1 respectively,
                and the switch is connected to pin 2 on the board.
            </p>
